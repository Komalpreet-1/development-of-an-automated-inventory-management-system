RESULTS ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION
In this chapter, you will demonstrate the results of your project and validate that the solution works as
intended.
1. Implementation of Solution
 Purpose: Provide a detailed description of the solution, focusing on how the design was
implemented. Show how the system meets the goals and objectives set in Chapter 2.
 Example: Walk through the features you developed, including screenshots, code snippets, or
descriptions of key functionalities (e.g., adding a product to the inventory or updating stock levels).
This is where you present the data and outcomes of your implementation. Depending on the type of
project, results can be quantitative or qualitative (or both).
Quantitative Results:
 If you are working with numerical data, such as performance metrics or system outputs, report
the results clearly. Use charts, tables, or graphs to present the data in a visually understandable
way.
Example:
"The system successfully tracked inventory in real time with a 98% accuracy rate for stock
levels. Performance tests showed that the system processed 100 transactions per minute, with
response times averaging 1.5 seconds per transaction. The following table illustrates the
comparison between manual and automated inventory tracking accuracy."
Metric Manual Inventory Automated Inventory Improvement (%)
Tracking Accuracy 85% 98% 15%
Transactions Processed/Minute 50 100 100%
Response Time (Seconds) 3 1.5 50%
 Key Findings: Present specific findings or patterns in the results. Did the solution meet the
expected targets, or were there any unexpected outcomes?
Example:
"The system performed well under normal conditions but showed a slight performance drop
when the database size exceeded 10,000 records. This is likely due to limitations in the
underlying SQL queries. Further optimization is needed."
Qualitative Results:
 In some cases, the outcomes may be more qualitative, especially if you're evaluating user
experience or subjective feedback.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The conclusion provides a final summary of the project and its outcomes, while future work suggests
possible areas for improvement or expansion.
5.1. Conclusion
 Purpose: Summarize the key achievements of the project and reflect on the problem-solving process. Did
you meet your objectives? What was the overall outcome?
 Example: The inventory management system was successfully developed, tested, and deployed, meeting
the client's needs for real-time stock tracking and reducing errors in inventory reporting.
5.2. Future Work
 Purpose: Discuss potential improvements or features that could be added in the future.
 Example: Future work could include adding advanced analytics, mobile app support, integration with
other business systems, or expanding the system to handle larger datasets.
